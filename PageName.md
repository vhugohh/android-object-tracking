# Introduction #

This wiki explains our soccer robot project that we completed for our senior design project at Miami University. The project utilized an android smart-phone interfaced with an Arduino micro controller. The phone is responsible for tracking the object and outputting a tone that changes with the required direction change of the robot. The micro controller is responsible for interpreting the correct direction to steer the robot based on the output from the phone.


# Details #

The following items are necessary to complete a working prototype:
  * Any Android smart-phone
  * Arduino Uno microcontroller
  * Arduino motor controller shield
  * Two DC motors
  * Ball caster
  * 9v battery to power Arduino and 4 AA batteries to power the motors
  * Wheels and robot body (wheel choice and body is up to you)

Steps to get a working prototype:
  1. Design and build your robot platform (see our design here)
  1. Get the object tracking app for your Android phone
  1. The app tracks an object but offers no strategy for your robot. You must add your own strategy based on  how you want the robot to behave.
  1. Get the interface code and program your Arduino to accept input from the phone
  1. Test your robot to insure that it behaves correctly
  1. If you think you have a good design challenge an opponent to see who has the better design
